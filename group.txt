I created a Git repository on GitHub.
I then invited Nikola via WhatsApp.
He then used this command: git clone "insert link" and git pull to confirm his repository was up to date.
I created a readme.md file in the repository and pushed it to the server using the following commands:
git add "README.md"
Git commit -m "Initial commit"
Git push
